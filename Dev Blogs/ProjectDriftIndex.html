					This week consisted mainly of familiarizing myself with Wolverine Soft Studios General Library and the architecture of their code base.
					In addition to that, I was able to play an hour or so of Hyper Light Drifter, observed some of the mechanics in the game, and conceptualize how
					they may have been implemented.  Overall, very excited to start this project with the Studio!

						<p>
							At the 1/22 meeting I was assigned to level design!  In the last 2 weeks I got to work on camera movement which involved learning a bit about Unity's cinemachines,
							creating a tutorial/informational popup text option, and probably my biggest and most exciting task of all, creating the game's Encounter system.

						<p>
							In week 4 developers were assigned to working on debugging, and in week 5 I was assigned to creating a crushing trap, structuring the game's scenes cutscene manager,
							and implementing a seamless way to transition between two scenes.

						<p>
							In the past few weeks, I was responsible with debugging and art implementation during our stability week.  Additionally, I took on updating the encounter system
							to not only be compatible with our boss enemies, but also to have a wave systems option.  On top of this, I added a range to which enemies can see a player, and only
							move when the player is within this range.

						<p>
							These weeks the studio started really focusing on art implementation so we could get the game one step closer to becoming a polished finished game!
